# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
## Overview

This project is an Air Quality Monitoring System designed to measure and display real-time air pollution levels. The system integrates multiple sensors to detect pollutants such as CO, NO2, PM2.5, temperature, and humidity, providing actionable insights to improve environmental and public health awareness.

The project is built using an Arduino Mega, various gas and dust sensors, and a buzzer/LED setup for real-time alerts. It is intended as a learning-focused project, giving hands-on experience with hardware, sensor interfacing, data processing, and alert mechanisms.

## Features

-Multi-Sensor Detection: Monitors CO, air quality index (AQI), dust concentration, temperature, and humidity.

-Real-Time Alerts: LEDs and buzzer provide immediate feedback when thresholds are exceeded.

-AQI Calculation: Processes raw sensor data to display meaningful air quality metrics.

-Simulation Tested: Verified sensor readings and communication logic in a simulated environment.

## Hardware Components

-Arduino Mega

-DHT11 (temperature & humidity)

-MQ7 & MQ135 (gas detection)

-GP2Y Dust Sensor

-LEDs, buzzer, resistors, capacitors, breadboard, and connecting wires
